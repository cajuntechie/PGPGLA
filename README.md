PGPNET Group Line Automator
===========================

ABOUT:
------

PGPNET Group Line Automator is a small program for Windows and Linux that fully automates the process of importing new PGP keys from the PGPNET group and inserting the new keys in a gpg.conf group line. 

HOW TO USE:
-----------

To use GLA, simply place the PGPNET.asc and pgpnet@yahoogroups.com.txt files in the same directory as the program. Run the program and hit GO to start the process. When it's done, your group line should be properly updated depending on the operating system you're using.

DEPENDENCIES:
-------------

Linux users will need to have the Gtk libraries installed.
